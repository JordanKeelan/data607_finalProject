    "### 1.1: Background and Context  \n",
    "\n",
    "Agricultural production is the foundation of the global economy. Globally it provides jobs to over 1 billion people (Map of the month 2020) and provides food security to billions. Without agriculture, there would be no way to support our current population numbers and density. Without affordable and efficient access to food, economies world collapse. The importance of agricultural production cannot be overstated. For this project we are focused on Spanish production.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Wine has always been an important beverage in society, not only for its taste and flavor; economically, wine production is a significant industry that generates billions of dollars in revenue each year. Moreover, wine is highly related with tourism, as people will travel to wineries to experience the production process and taste different varieties of wine, this has a huge positive impact on local economies, as tourism can create jobs and generate revenue for local businesses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Socially, wine plays an important role as it often accompanies celebrations and special occasions. Wine brings people together, creating and strengthening relationships.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Spain is one of the most important wine-producing countries in the world and according to the International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV), is among the top three wine-producing countries along with Italy and France. In 2020, Spain produced 1,310,174 tons of wine, accounting for 16% of the world's total wine production. \n",
    "\n",
    "As population continues to grow, so must food production. As we enter an era of increased variance in global temperatures, weather patterns, and natural disasters understanding the nature of food production trends will be necessary in assessing the health of our agricultural industries. Forecasting can help to inform law/policy makers, it can help to optimize resource allocation, and inform supply chains. \n",
    "\n",
    "Time series analysis is a statistical and machine learning technique used to model trends and forecast future values of temporal data. This type of analysis will be effective in understanding, describing, and predicting trends in agricultural data production. Time series analysis techniques such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Facebook Prophet, can be employed to model and predict crop production trends. Each of these methods offers unique advantages and limitations, depending on the underlying data structure, model complexity, and forecasting requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2: Objectives of the Study  \n",
    "\n",
    "This study aims to apply different time series analysis techniques to the FAOSTAT production indices dataset, obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), to forecast crop production trends. The results will provide insights into the most appropriate time series forecasting method for predicting crop production trends and offer valuable input for decision-making in agricultural planning and management. \n",

    "\n",
    "The ARIMA model is composed of three components:  \n",
    "- Autoregressive Component: represents the correlation between the current value of the time series and its past values. \n",
    "- Integrated Component: represents the differencing of the time series to make it stationary. \n",
    "- Moving Average Component: represents the correlation between the current value and the errors of past predictions. \n",

To prove it, we used the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, this test has a Null Hypothesis that the data is non-stationary. We obtained a p_value of 0.00007, meaning that we can reject the Null, and state that our data presents stationarity.  \n",

    "To implement the ARIMA model in python we used the *ARIMA* class present in the *statsmodels.tsa.arima.model* module as it provides a convenient way to fit an ARIMA model into a time series analysis and offers the possibility to forecast and evaluate the model.  \n",
